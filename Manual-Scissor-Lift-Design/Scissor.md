## Description
For the Engineering Design I (EDPT501) course, the project focused on designing a manual scissor lift table. The objective was to create a robust and reliable lift table utilizing a power screw mechanism. The design aimed to support a maximum weight of 500kg with a factor of safety of 1.3, ensuring safe and efficient lifting operations. The lift table was required to have a minimum height of 500mm and a maximum height of 1000mm, offering a suitable range for various lifting applications.

The project followed a comprehensive design process, starting with the analysis of stresses and forces involved in the lift table's operation. All stress and force calculations were performed manually, employing fundamental engineering principles to ensure the lift table's structural integrity and load-bearing capacity.

Once the initial analysis was complete, the project transitioned to the implementation phase. The design was meticulously modeled using Solidworks, a powerful computer-aided design (CAD) software, allowing for precise visualization and optimization of the lift table's components.

The design process also incorporated the factor of safety, with a value of 1.3 chosen to provide an additional margin of safety beyond the expected load requirements. This factor accounted for potential variations in load distribution and unexpected loading scenarios, enhancing the overall reliability and safety of the lift table.

By combining theoretical calculations, manual analysis, and advanced CAD modeling, the project successfully achieved its goals. The final design represented a significant accomplishment, demonstrating the ability to create a robust and reliable manual scissor lift table that met the prescribed performance criteria.
