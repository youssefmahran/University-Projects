## Description
For the Computer Programming (CSEN401) course, the project involved developing a Marvel-themed computer game using Java and JavaFX. The objective was to create an engaging gaming experience with a focus on mechanics and graphical user interface (GUI) implementation.

The game was designed to accommodate both 2 players and a single player facing off against a computer-controlled AI. The core gameplay revolved around strategic battles between players' chosen heroes. Each player selected 3 heroes to compete on a 5x5 grid, where they fought until only one emerged as the winner.

To enhance the gameplay, random obstacles were placed throughout the grid, adding an element of challenge and strategic decision-making. These obstacles required players to carefully navigate the grid and plan their moves accordingly.

One of the key highlights of the project was the implementation of the computer-controlled AI. The AI mode was skillfully developed, providing an intelligent and challenging opponent for single-player matches. This aspect of the project earned additional recognition and a bonus grade.

The graphical user interface (GUI) was implemented using JavaFX, ensuring an immersive and visually appealing gaming experience. The GUI design incorporated Marvel-themed elements, capturing the essence of the Marvel universe and enhancing player engagement.

Each hero in the game possessed unique attributes and abilities, adding depth and complexity to the gameplay. Players had to strategize and master the strengths and weaknesses of their chosen heroes to achieve victory.

By successfully completing this project, I demonstrated my ability to design and implement a sophisticated computer game using Java and JavaFX. The project showcased my skills in programming logic, GUI development, and creating an engaging user experience.
